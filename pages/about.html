            I'm Cameron Crosby. Raised in Hamilton County, IN and living in Indianapolis, I spend my time learning full-stack web development and human-computer interaction. I've created sample projects for games, e-commerce, blogs, and more. In my free time, I play video games, watch movies, and go hiking.
