        I am a student studying Full Stack Web Development at Indiana
        University's Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering in
        Indianapolis.<br /><br />
        I've spent my time learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to become a
        capable Front-End Engineer, and my studies now revolve around
        implementing back-end development strategies. I aim to provide a wide
        range of skills that I can use to be more efficient in projects.<br /><br />
        I'm looking for internships for the coming year in the Greater
        Indianapolis area, but I'm open to remote work as well.
